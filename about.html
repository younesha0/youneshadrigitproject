            <h2>Why Nature Matters</h2>
            <p>
                Nature gives us everything we need—clean air, fresh water, nutritious food, 
                and a stable climate. It also provides relaxation, inspiration, and a sense 
                of connection to something greater. By appreciating and protecting nature, 
                we help build a healthier future for our planet and all living creatures.
